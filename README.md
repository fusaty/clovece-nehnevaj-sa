# Django Web Framework

Django is a web framework for building web applications in Python. It follows the 
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a range of tools for 
handling HTTP requests, managing databases, and rendering HTML templates.

Django is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability, making it a popular 
choice for building web applications of all sizes. With Django, developers can quickly 
build and deploy web applications without having to worry about low-level details such 
as database management, URL routing, or form handling.

Some of the key features of Django include:

    Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database management
    Built-in admin interface for managing application data
    Automatic URL routing and template rendering
    Support for various authentication mechanisms
    Plug-and-play support for multiple caching backends
    Extensive documentation and community support

Django has been used to build some of the most popular websites and web applications 
on the internet, including Instagram, Pinterest, and Mozilla. Whether you're building a 
small personal blog or a large-scale enterprise application, Django has the tools and 
flexibility to help you get the job done.

which is the first bigger program in Python I have written :(
